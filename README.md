## grub-password

Basic grub password for grub v1 a and group v2.
Ths role sets global password to restrinct the menu editing.
Thos role is not able to set passwords or users for v2 per item.

I tested this role on platforms listed int mate file, but it do not mean it will work on any other. Please and the corresponding `vars/os-<PLATFORM>.yml` or `vars/os-<PLATFORM>-<VERSION>.yml` file.

## Requirements

None

## 	Role Variables

Role variables are grub version dependent, see `defaults/main.yml`.

Default password is `changeme`, so please follow this recommendation.

### grub v1

`grub_password_v1_passwd` is md5 password generated by `/sbin/grub-md5-crypt`

### grub v2

Line generated by `grub_password_v2_admin` and `grub_password_v2_passwd` are

```
set superusers="{{ grub_password_v2_admin }}"
password_pbkdf2 {{ grub_password_v2_admin }} {{ grub_password_v2_passwd }}" 
```

`grub_password_v2_unrestricted` tells weather you want to add `--unrestriced` to the menu entries. If this directice is missing, the system will not boot without antering username and password.



## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - hudecof.grub-password
